# cmrn/jekyll-webhook
`cmrn/jekyll-webhook` is a docker image which:

1. Builds a Jekyll site from source
2. Runs an Nginx server to host the website
3. Creates a GitHub webhook to pull in any new changes to the site

## Basic Usage
### Step 1 - Docker
To start `cmrn/jekyll-webhook` on port 80:

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 \ 
           -e REPO="https://github.com/cmrn/cameronmoon.com.git" \ 
           -e WEBHOOK_SECRET="change me" \ 
           cmrn/jekyll-webhook
```

Set `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to variable to a long, random passphrase, and set `REPO` to the clone URL of your GitHub repository.

### Step 2 - GitHub
To set up the webhook in GitHub, go to your repository page, then go to Settings > Webhooks & Services > Add webhook. Set "Payload URL" to your server's address, followed by `/webhook` - for example, `http://cameronmoon.com/webhook`. Set "Secret" to the same value as `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. "Content type" should be "application/json", and the Webhook should only recieve the "push" event.

## Configuration
The image can be given the following configuration values as environment variables:

- `REPO`: Required. The clone URL for your Jekyll repository. If your repository is private, this should also contain a username and password.
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: Required. The secret which authenticates genuine requests to the webhook. This should be a long, random secret shared only with GitHub.
- `WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT`: Optional, defaults to `/webhook`. The endpoint for the webhook. Change this if you want to publish something at the URL `/webhook`.
- `BRANCH`: Optional, defaults to `master`. The branch to use from your repository. Another popular value is `gh-pages`, used by GitHub Pages.

### Advanced Configuration
It's also possible to customise the nginx server configuration by linking in a new `site.conf` template. Save `site.conf` to your host machine, make your changes, and link it into your container:

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 \
           -v /path/to/your/site.conf:/site.conf \ 
           -e REPO="https://github.com/cmrn/cameronmoon.com.git" \ 
           -e WEBHOOK_SECRET="change me" \ 
           cmrn/jekyll-webhook
```
